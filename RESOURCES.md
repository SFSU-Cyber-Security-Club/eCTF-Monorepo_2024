# Resources

This is a list of resources for teaching and communication for this CTF. I'll update this as I find more resources.

## For the CTF Itself

- [MITRE eCTF Slack](https://mitre-ectf.slack.com/): The Slack for the eCTF. Announcements and general discussion happen here, so make sure you're in it.
- [MITRE eCTF Website](https://ectfmitre.gitlab.io/ectf-website/index.html): The actual website for the eCTF. Contains the rules, schedule, and other important information.
- [eCTF Rules](https://ectfmitre.gitlab.io/ectf-website/rules.html): **Read. The. Rules.** You need to be familiar with these. The worst thing you can do is get the team disqualified because you didn't read the rules.

## Programming

We will be programming in Rust for this hackathon. Use these resources to get yourself familiar with the language and how to use it for embedded development:

- [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/): Start here if you are new to Rust.
- [Embedded Rust Discovery Book](https://docs.rust-embedded.org/discovery/microbit): Start here if you are new to embedded programming.
- [Embedded Rust Book](https://docs.rust-embedded.org/book/intro/index.html): Once you've gone through the Discovery book, this is the next step. This book assumes you're familiar with cross compilation, memory mapped peripherals, interrupts, and I2C.

## Hardware

The board we will be developing/attacking is the Analog Devices MAX78000FTHR. Use these resources to get yourself familiar with it:
