\begin{abstract}
This research focuses on designing and implementing a secure MISC device that will be built to adhere to the standards of the functional and security requirements. Our design will 
aim to withstand all attack scenarios presented by the MITRE documentation, as well as provide a new approach to embedded system programming with the popular and recent memory-safe Rust programming language.

\section{Functional Requirements}

We plan to meet the functional requirements by doing x, y, and z.

\section{Security Requirements}

\subsection{Security Requirement 1}
Security Requirement 1 requires us to ensure the Application Processor will not boot unless
expected components are present and valid. Our plan for this involves a two-pronged approach
which uses public/private key encryption and a secure cryptographic nonce.

During the build process, we will generate a public/private key pair. The public key will be
flashed onto the components, and the private key will be stored in the application processor.
Additionally, a random seed will be generated using /dev/urandom and stored in the application
processor. This seed will be used to generate a cryptographic nonce which will be sent to the
components. The components will use the public key to encrypt the nonce along with their own
unique identifier and send it back to the application processor. The application processor will
use the private key to decrypt the nonce and verify that it matches the original nonce. If the
nonces match, the application processor will know that the components are valid and will boot.
If no message is received, or the nonces do not match, the application processor will not boot.

Once the application processor 

% REFERENCE LIST
%   - use \thebibliography and \bibitems to enter references, no separate .bib
%     files
%   - use normal font for *everything* (no bold typefaces etc.)
%   - shorten the last page number, i.e. 51--9 for pages 51--59
%   - for more than 6 authors the first 6 should be listed followed by et al.
%     - use \emph{et al.} for the et al.
%   - end each reference with a period
