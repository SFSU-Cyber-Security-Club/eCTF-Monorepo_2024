# Template Quickstart

This folder is a template for writeups, written in LaTeX.

**What is LaTeX?**

LaTeX is a document preparation system. When writing a document, you programatically define the structure of the document, and then compile it to a PDF. This is different from a WYSIWYG editor, where you directly edit the document and the editor handles the structure for you.

**Why LaTeX?**

LaTeX is a very powerful tool for writing documents. It is especially useful for writing technical documents, such as writeups. LaTeX is also very popular in the academic world, so it is a good skill to have.

(it also looks cool)

**How LaTeX?**

Good question!

## Setup

### Your Environment

There are a couple different ways to set up an environment for writing LaTeX, but the main way I'd recommend is to use the [LaTeX Workshop](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=James-Yu.latex-workshop) and [LaTeX Utilities](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tecosaur.latex-utilities) extensions for VSCode.
This will allow you to write LaTeX in VSCode, and compile it to a PDF with a single click.

**Installation**

1. Install [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) if you haven't already.
2. Go to the extensions tab and search for "LaTeX Workshop" and "LaTeX Utilities".
3. Install both extensions.

### Setting up your Document

1. Copy the contents of this folder (except for this README) to a new folder.
2. Open the template.tex file in VSCode. You can rename this file to whatever you want.
3. Start writing your writeup!

When you save, if you have the extensions set up correctly, it should automatically build the PDF for you. If you want to manually build the PDF, you can press `Ctrl+Alt+B` or `Cmd+Alt+B`.

I'd recommend having the PDF open in a separate split from the LaTeX file, so you can see the changes you make as you make them.

### Actually learning LaTeX

I'm not going to go into detail about how to write LaTeX, because there are plenty of resources out there that do a better job than I could. Here are some good ones:

- [LaTeX WikiBook](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX)
- [Overleaf Learn LaTeX in 30 Minutes](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Learn_LaTeX_in_30_minutes)
- [LaTeX Tutorial](https://www.latex-tutorial.com/tutorials/)

The best way to learn is probably just to mess around with the template and see what happens. If you want to do something, just google it and you'll probably find an answer.
